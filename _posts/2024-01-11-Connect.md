Today I started to feel a good amount better after being sick. I woke up later, and really didn't have a lot of motivation today, I could have gotten a lot done but I didn't. That's why
this is being written at 7:41 p.m. Tomorrow I will be more productive, instead of just watching TV. I did get chipolte though, that was preetty good.
